Shizuku Package Installer
========================
A lightweight yet powerful package installer for Android.

## Installation Methods

This installer supports multiple privilege elevation methods:

1. **Shizuku** (Primary): Uses Shizuku service for privileged operations
2. **Root Fallback**: Automatically uses root privileges when Shizuku is unavailable

The installer will automatically try Shizuku first, and if it's not available or lacks permissions, it will fall back to using root access if available on the device.

Features
-------
- **Split APKs**: Install `.apks` files generated by `bundletool`. The installer will selects the most suitable split APKs, mimicking the logic of `bundletool install-apks`.
- **APK Dumps**: Install apps from zipped APK dumps (a zip file containing all base and split APKs from `pm path`).
- **Zipped APKs**: Install a single APK from within a ZIP archive.
- **Add Splits**: Add new split APKs to an existing application.
- **Remove Splits**: Remove split APKs from existing application.
- **Interactive Split Installation**: When installing an app that requires splits, user can progressively add more APK files without needing to package them into a single zip file beforehand.
- **Archive Apps**: Archive installed applications to a zip file, which can be used for backup or sharing.
